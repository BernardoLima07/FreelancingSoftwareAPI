## _Additional Features_

## There should be a way that to only contractors with yours tokens JWT able to access Job endpoint. Because clients too able to access Job endpoint, but those who could access this endpoint must only be contractors... It could be a new feature to be implemented.

## _Challengers_

## Using SQLite, as it was new to me, so i search for tutorials and documentation on how to use it.

## _Future Improvements_

There should be a architecture pattern, Clean Architecture for example, that should be implemented on future for several reasons.
